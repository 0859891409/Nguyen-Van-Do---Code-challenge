## Code Inefficiencies and Refactoring Suggestions

### 1. Filtering Logic Issues in `sortedBalances`
- The filtering condition contains an error:
  ```ts
  if (lhsPriority > -99) {
     if (balance.amount <= 0) {
       return true;
     }
  }
  ```
  - `lhsPriority` is undefined; `balancePriority` should be used.
  - The filter only keeps balances with `amount <= 0`, which likely isn't the intended logic.

### 2. Redundant Sorting Operations
- `getPriority()` is repeatedly called in the sort comparator, leading to unnecessary overhead.
- Sorting doesn't account for equal priority values, potentially resulting in unstable ordering.

### 3. Redundant Dependency in `useMemo`
- Including `prices` in the dependency array causes unwarranted recalculations as `prices` aren't utilized during sorting.

### 4. Incorrect Formatting in `formattedBalances`
- `toFixed()` without parameters defaults to `toFixed(0)`, discarding decimal values.

### 5. Type Mismatch in `rows`
- `rows` iterates over `sortedBalances` (type `WalletBalance`), yet expects properties from `FormattedWalletBalance`.
- `formattedBalances` is generated but not actually used in `rows`.

### 6. Inefficient Key Usage in `WalletRow`
- Utilizing `index` as a `key` can lead to performance issues when reordering occurs.
- Prefer a consistent identifier, such as `balance.currency`, for keys.

## Recommended Enhancements

### 1. Corrected Filtering Condition
- Filter to retain positive balances and replaced `lhsPriority` with `balancePriority`.

### 2. Streamlined Sorting
- Cached priority values to avoid repetitive calls to `getPriority()`.
- Incorporated logic to handle equal priorities gracefully.

### 3. Optimized `useMemo` Dependencies
- Removed `prices` from `useMemo` dependency array since it's not part of the sorting logic.

### 4. Enhanced Number Formatting
- Implemented `toFixed(2)` for precise decimal formatting.

### 5. Fixed Type Discrepancy in `rows`
- Used `formattedBalances` as the source for mapping `rows`.

### 6. Stable Keys in `WalletRow`
- Adopted `balance.currency` as a key to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
